# Socketer Project

## What is it?
Inspired slightly by [Discord][discord] and [Telegram][telegram], is a casual realtime chat, where you can access any room you like, and talk to the people in that room.
But not only! It provides a series of other features, like widgets, so you can integrate in your webpage a widget showing the activity in one room.
And with this feature, comes also a widget creator, a tool that helps in creating the perfect widget with low effort.

For now, this project does not include an index webpage, to "showcase" the service properly.

## What gived to me?
Is a project that allowed me to grow and strengthen my knowledge in [Express][express], [Socket.io][socket.io], [NodeJS][node.js], [EJS templating engine][ejs] and of course frontend languages.

## From where comes the name and logo?
Obviously the logo and the name are tributes to the [socket.io][socket.io] library, witch allowed me to easily implement a stable handshake connection between client and server.

## Can I reuse it?
Of course, you can! The project is under MIT license, you are free to reuse the code as you want!

## How I run the thing?
Obviusly you need to have [Node JS][node.js] and [NPM][npm] installed.
After you downloaded the source and opened an terminal in the source folder, you can execute the following commands:

$ `npm intall` - to install all the dependencies. <br>
$ `npm audit fix` - to fix vulnerabilities. <br>
$ `node .` - to start it.

And voila! The [Node JS][node.js] application will be hosted at http://localhost:3000/.
